Our project focuses on developing an AI-powered system for prostate cancer lesion segmentation
using the **U-Net architecture**. The solution aims to **automate MRI image analysis**, improving diagnostic accuracy and reducing radiologist workload. Built with
**real-world hospital collaborations** and an **authorized dataset from Tata Memorial Hospital, Mumbai**, the model is deployable using **FastAPI and Firebase**. 
Future integration of **transformers** aims to enhance precision and scalability.
